<p>
Welcome to my website! My name is Atakan Hilmi F&#305rat and I am a postdoctoral scholar at 
<a href="https://qmap.ucdavis.edu">Center for Quantum Mathematics and Physics (QMAP)</a>
of
<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu">University of California Davis</a>.
I have completed my Ph.D. in physics at
<a href="https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/">Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP)</a>
of
<a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>
under the supervision of 
<a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/barton-zwiebach/">Barton Zwiebach</a>.
I have earned my B.A. in physics and mathematics at
<a href="https://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder</a>. 
You can find my CV
<A HREF="./cv.pdf">here</A>. Feel free to reach me at
<a href="mailto:ahfirat@ucdavis.edu">ahfirat@ucdavis.edu</a>.

<p>
My research focuses on string theory---string field theory (SFT) in particular, which is an attempt to formulate string theory nonperturbatively. I am still not entirely convinced whether this is the right approach for this problem to be honest; but this is the entire point of my research! Hope to see more progress in future. See
<A href="./summary.html">here</A>
to read the summary of my research, together with my reflections and confessions that would have been quite inappropriate to include to the papers themselves. You can refer to
<a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1846006">Inspire</a>,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/a/firat_a_1">arXiv</a>, or
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NrY5Fq0AAAAJ&hl=tr">Google Scholar</a>
for the proper works.
</p>

<p>This website is mostly academically-oriented. I also aim to share 
my personal thoughts
on things that I find somewhat profound---not necessarily limited to physics---from time to time. Let us see what the future holds... </p>
